# System Media Controller for Alfred

This is a simple nmeumonic workflow.

---

**Keyword:** `media`

**Actions:** `play`, `pause`, `next`, `prev`, `up`, `down`

---

With this Alfred Workflow, you can control the currently running media playing on your mac, by emulating the media keys using a python script

Its as easy as `media play` -- **note**, play and pause toggles, but are both included for easier recall.

`media up` and `media down` control volume respectively. These are included so we can remember _just one command_ -- `media` -- to control our media.

Enjoy :smile:
